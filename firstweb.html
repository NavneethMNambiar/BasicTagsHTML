            Cheranellore is a small green village located at about 10kms to the north of Ernakulam town. This village is blessed with one of the 108 major Durga temples in the country namely the Cheranellor Bhagavathy Kshetram. 
            The presiding deity of the temple is <q>Kaarthyaayani Devi</q>. Though worshipped thus, She is Aadiparaashakthi in all glory. Worshipping this Devi bestows upon the devotees blessing for a life time and removes all agony and sins. 
            A mother to every devotee, she generously showers her blessings in the form of knowledge, peace and prosperity
